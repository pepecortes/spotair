Admin component: should clear messages when first started

PICTADD: received the following error: "Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, copyfile '/tmp/upload_96f3ef1e89f4843f6e8b4374e222c718' -> '/app/dev_localstorage/undefined/15.jpg'"

Check again if bootstrap-vue requires @babel/runtime dependency. It should not, and I do not understand why
