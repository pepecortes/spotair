Change to NODE 12
	
When using REMOTE: validation takes a long time: add icon for waiting
In validation: why can I select an immat that does not correspond to the avion?
In pictadd, we can try to skip avion if immat is selected from list (instead of free text)
Same thing with the couple galerie-aerodrome
Pictadd profile: nom premon do not appear

Check again if bootstrap-vue requires @babel/runtime dependency. It should not, and I do not understand why
