VALIDATE PHOTO
	following the replacement of vue-select (vue-multiselect now) the page has lost functionality

WATERMARK FUNCTION (SpotairPict.js)
	needs improvement (i.e. when data is NIL)
	suggestion: make a 'caption' virtual getter in the model

DATABASE MIGRATION
	after the migration, many users will have a username xxx@nomail.com. how to manage this?
	
ADMIN
	the select list (in admin) does not work with a large number of entries
	(i.e. Appareils)

When using REMOTE: validation takes a long time: add icon for waiting
In validation: why can I select an immat that does not correspond to the avion?
In pictadd, we can try to skip avion if immat is selected from list (instead of free text)
Same thing with the couple galerie-aerodrome
Pictadd profile: nom premon do not appear
