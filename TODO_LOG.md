PROPOSAL: refactor SpotairPict so as to return a buffer out of the toPicture and toThumbnail functions
(remember the way the picture size is computed: you will need it)
then refactor storage so as to compute the image size after having created Picture


API call photos/recent is broken

In pictadd, we can try to skip avion if immat is selected from list (instead of free text)
Same thing with the couple galerie-aerodrome

Check again if bootstrap-vue requires @babel/runtime dependency. It should not, and I do not understand why
