DATABASE MIGRATION
	after the migration, many users will have a username xxx@nomail.com. how to manage this?
	
LIKES
	we have not created a LIKES system. once done, ensure that the database migration takes it into account
	perhaps you should remove the field 'views' from the photos Model

ADMIN
	the select list (in admin) does not work with a large number of entries

When using REMOTE: validation takes a long time: add icon for waiting
In validation: why can I select an immat that does not correspond to the avion?
In pictadd, we can try to skip avion if immat is selected from list (instead of free text)
Same thing with the couple galerie-aerodrome
Pictadd profile: nom premon do not appear
